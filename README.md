# World Mirror
A mod for the game Factorio, mirroring the world map north/south and/or east/west.

This mod will ensure that both halves, or all four quarters, of your world map
are identical mirror images of each other, for multiplayer/challenge balance.

There are mod settings available to control mirroring on the X and Y axes.

It will only apply to newly generated chunks, and will produce discontinuities
in existing maps.
